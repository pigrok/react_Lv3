# 📚 Create My Todo List

# 🚩 What to implement
Modal

- Implement two modals.
  - Modal not closing when `cancel`, `confirm`, and overlay is clicked
  - Just a `close` button, and the modal closes when the overlay is clicked.
  - The button that turns the modal `on` should look different for each. (You can reuse the button you created above.)

Button

- Implement a total of 6 button shapes (see example page)
  - Implement using `styled-components`, and make good use of props as appropriate.
  - Once you've configured your (select) button component, try adding an icon as well

Input

  - Implement using `styled-components`, and make good use of props as appropriate.
  - Once you've configured your (select) button component, try adding an icon as well
 
Input

- Implement a total of two inputs.
  - Generic input
  - When entering numbers, input with `comma ,` after every 3 digits
  - Implement a form, enter a value in each input, and when the `save` button is pressed, display `{name: "any text", price: "amount without commas"}` in an `alert`.
- Select
- select를 구현합니다.
  - When you click select, you'll get a list of options, and clicking an option will change the value of select.
  - Implement to prevent it from being hidden by the parent element when select is clicked. Applying `overflow: hidden` to the parent element will cause the child component to be `hidden` when it overflows the parent component. Even if the parent component has the hidden property, select should not be hidden.
